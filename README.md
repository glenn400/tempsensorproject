# tempsensorproject
This repository will hold the temperature sensor project
A temperature senor that outputs said integer to a digital display.
The temperature sensor has many applications ranging from being used to monitor temperature in a certain setting like a lab or for various experiments where being aware of the slightest temperature change is crucial. 
For this project I use the beagle bone black
a temperature sensor and a device to display the values. 
I also use various wires and a bread board for a circuit.
